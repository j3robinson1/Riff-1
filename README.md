#-Riff-
#Riff creates an organic musical conversation between users by allowing them to record spontaneous thoughts in the form of a 30-second audio clip.  The user can either upload a new recording or "riff" on another user's recording in the same form of a 30-second audio clip.  A user across the world will be able to hear a previously posted riff and respond immediately with his/her own musical layer.
